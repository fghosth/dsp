package openrtb

// 3.2.9 Object: Native
//
// This object represents a native type impression.
// Native ad units are intended to blend seamlessly into the surrounding content (e.g., a sponsored Twitter or Facebook post).
// As such, the response must be well-structured to afford the publisher fine-grained control over rendering.
//
// The Native Subcommittee has developed a companion specification to OpenRTB called the Dynamic Native Ads API.
// It defines the request parameters and response markup structure of native ad units.
// This object provides the means of transporting request parameters as an opaque string so that the specific parameters can evolve separately under the auspices of the Dynamic Native Ads API.
// Similarly, the ad markup served will be structured according to that specification.
//
// The presence of a Native as a subordinate of the Imp object indicates that this impression is offered as a native type impression.
// At the publisherâ€™s discretion, that same impression may also be offered as banner, video, and/or audio by also including as Imp subordinates objects of those types.
// However, any given bid for the impression must conform to one of the offered types.
